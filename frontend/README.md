## Setup - frontend (React + Typescript)

1. `cd frontend`
2. `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file in the root folder. You will need to request the contents of this file from the admin of this project.
4. `npm start`

## Setup - backend (Node JS)

3. `npm start`

**Note: Frontend calls are being made to the live version of backend. You must change the axios requests to use backend localhost if you want to run everything completely local**
